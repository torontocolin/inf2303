      title : An Introduction
      summary : |
        What is free software? What is open source software?
        (What is the difference?)
        Why do we care?
        (Who uses it anyway?)
        What do we know about those phenomena and what do we want to learn about them?
        How will we go about understanding free and open source software in this course?
        Bonus: A quick introduction to the history of computing.

  title : Software and Intellectual Property

      title : | 
        Intellectual Property: Theory and History
      summary : |
        To properly contextualize free / open source software, we must first understand
        why software is protected as intellectual property in the first place.
        In this class we look at the history and theory behind intellectual propertly generally.
        What are “public goods”?
        (Specifically, what does it mean for something to be “nonrival” and “non-excludable”?)
        In what sense are ideas and software “public goods”?
        Why might it make sense to limit the use of information goods?
        What are some of the other ways of supporting production of such goods?
        What would be some of the alternatives to intelletual property?

      title : Software as Intellectual Property
      summary : |
