<h1>Course Objectives</h1>
<p>The course will explore the production of free / open source software
  (“F/OSS”) — that is, software that users are allowed to modify and
  redistribute without paying royalties.
In the recent years such software has grown in prominence.
Today it includes both popular end-user software such as Mozilla
  Firefox and Google Chrome, as well as back-end software that today
  dominates in many domains of IT infrastructure (e.g., the Apache
  web-server and the GNU/Linux operating system).
Availability of such software presents both opportunities and
  challenges to today’s IT professionals.
Is F/OSS really a “free lunch” or does it present hidden costs? Why do
  many practitioners insist that choosing royalty-free F/OSS products
  should not be about saving money on royalties?
When does it make sense for an organization to adopt a F/OSS solution
  over a proprietary one?
When would it make sense to develop a software solution in house and
  offer it to the world with a F/OSS license?
To answer such questions it becomes important to understand what F/OSS
  is (and what is the difference between “free” and “open source”),
  and where it comes from.
We would also need to understand who makes such software and why they
  do so.
We will ask why individuals and organizations contribute time and
  money to F/OSS and how they coordinate their activities.
We will also ask whether the open source software model can be applied
  to other goods, e.g., “open source textbooks” or “open source
  pharmaceuticals”?
In addressing those questions we will draw on a range of social
  science theories, looking at F/OSS from economic, political and
  cultural sides.
We will also ask questions about the technical infrastructure used by
  F/OSS projects.</p>
<h1>Student Learning Objectives</h1>
<p>The students will develop an understanding of free / open source
  software ecosystem, including its history and current practices.
They will also learn to draw on their understanding of F/OSS to
  analyse the opportunities and challenges that such software presents
  in specific contexts faced by information professionals.
Finally, they will learn how to extend their observations about free /
  open source software to other information products.</p>
<h1>Relationship to Program-Level Master of Information Student Learning Outcomes</h1>
<p>The course will help students understand and become conversant with an
  important set of information practices: production of free / open
  source software.
It will also provide them with a foundation for analyzing peer
  production of other information products. (Outcome 1.)</p>
<p>Students will develop knowledge and values that will help them
  exercise leadership when it comes to making software choices that
  broader access to information services for all. (Outcome 2.)</p>
<p>The students’ work on the term paper will help them develop their
  research abilities and to apply course material to a specific domain
  of information studies. (Outcome 3.)</p>
<p>The students will gain knowledge of a range of social science theories
  relevant to understanding production of information goods. (Outcome
  4.)</p>
<p>Student learning outcomes for the MI program:
<a href="http://www.ischool.utoronto.ca/studies/learning-outcomes/">http://www.ischool.utoronto.ca/studies/learning-outcomes/</a></p></div><div class='box' id='evaluation'><h1>Course Structure</h1>
<p>This course will be taught as a seminar.
While the instructor will at times present material to complement the
  readings, much of the time will be spent discussing and analyzing
  the readings.
Students are expected to take responsibility for their learning of the
  material through active engagement with the assigned readings,
  through participation in course discussion, and through their
  individual work on a research paper.</p>
<h1>Deliverables and Evaluation</h1>
<p>Grades will be based on the following components:</p>
<ul>
<li>preparation for the class (“memos,” <strong>15%</strong> of the course grade),</li>
<li>contribution to class discussion (<strong>15%</strong>),</li>
<li>the term paper (three deliverables jointly worth <strong>50%</strong>),</li>
<li>reviews of other students’ paper proposals (<strong>10%</strong>),</li>
<li>a course “patch” (<strong>10%</strong>, see below).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Contribution to Class Discussion — 15%</h3>
<p>As the course will be taught in the form of a seminar, students will
  be graded for their contribution to the class discussion.
<span class="important">Please be advised that contribution does not
  mean attendance.</span>
(Of course, you cannot contribute without being present.)
Students who attend the class but remain silent will earn no
  credit.
Nor, however, does it mean simply speaking a lot.
Rather, students are expected to come to class prepared, actively
  listen to what is being said by others and then make contributions
  to the discussion that take advantage of their own understanding of
  the readings and of what has been said up to that point.
Class discussion will follow a structure that will be described in a
  handout.
Each student will be asked to serve as one of the “chairs” for
  one week’s discussion and as a “panelist” on several other ones.
Students who have difficulty speaking in public should see the
  instructor early in the semester, so that we could discuss possible
  remedies.</p>
<h3>Memos — 15%</h3>
<p>For all classes other than the first and the last, the students will
  prepare “memos” on the readings assigned for that class.
Each memo should be no longer than 1 page and should be formatted in
  accordance with this template:
  <a href="handouts/memo_template.pdf">memo_template.pdf</a>,
  <a href="handouts/memo_template.odt">memo_template.odt</a>,
  <a href="handouts/memo_template.doc">memo_template.doc</a>,
  <a href="handouts/memo_template.rtf">memo_template.rft</a>.</p>
<p>The purpose of the memos is to help you make better sense of the
  readings and to increase the quality of the in-class discussion by
  ensuring that all students arrive to class having done the readings
  and having spent some time thinking about them.</p>
<p>Each memo should consist of four sections.</p>
<ul>
<li>Central issues in the readings;</li>
<li>The points on which the authors agree and disagree;</li>
<li>Your position on the issues (with explanation);</li>
<li>Three questions for discussion in the class (provide a brief
  explanation of your questions if necessary).</li>
</ul>
<p>The memos are due by email, <span class="important">by 8 am of the day
  of each class</span>. (Please see below on the late policy for
  memos.)
  Please <span class="important">email your memo as a PDF attachment to all members of your team <strong>and</strong> the instructor.</span>
  Please <span class="important">put “INF2303 memo for <em>date</em> class” for subject.</span>
  (Subsitute the correct date of the class, e.g., “INF2303 memo for July 10 class.”)
Students responsible for chairing each class will be tasked with
  reading and summarizing submitted memos in writing.</p>
<h3>Term Paper and Presentation - 50%</h3>
<p>A major component of the course is a term paper exploring a specific
  topic related to the content of the course.</p>
<p>There are three deliverables related to this term paper, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>a paper proposal,</li>
<li>a presentation (on August 19),</li>
<li>the final paper.</li>
</ul>
<p>The proposal, the presentation, and the final paper will be graded
  <span class="important">together</span> and will be jointly worth
  50% of your grade.</p>
<p>It is recommended that students work on their papers in <span
  class="important">teams of two</span>.
However, they can opt to work individually or in groups of three.</p>
<p>Students can pick paper topics that best align with their professional
  interests, as long as there is a clear relationship to the topics
  discussed in the course and as long as the topic is discussed in
  appropriate depth.
Here are some examples of appropriate topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>A paper analysing available free / open source software for
  libraries and making an argument for or against use of such software
  over proprietary solutions.</li>
<li>A paper exploring the history of a particular F/OSS product to
  challenge some of the common assumptions about how such projects
  work.</li>
<li>A paper looking at information management practices in a F/OSS
  project, pointing to ways such practices could be applied in other
  domains or suggesting improvements.</li>
<li>A paper analyzing peer production of a particular kind of digital
  goods other than software.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>The list above is meant to exemplify appropriate topics and is not
  exhaustive.</i></p>
<p>Due to the short duration of the course, students should start working
  on their papers <span class="important">very early</span>, ideally
  not later than the second week of the course.</p>
<h4>Paper Proposal</h4>
<p>Prior to developing the paper, each team will prepare a paper
  proposal.
The teams will share their paper proposals with the rest of the class
  to receive feedback from other students.</p>
<p>The <strong>main text</strong> of the proposal should be up to 2 pages long and
  should answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the topic that the paper will focus on?</li>
<li>Why is this topic interesting in the context of this course?</li>
<li>What claims do you expect to make in this paper and how do you
  expect to support them?</li>
</ul>
<p>Your proposal should also include a <strong>2 page annotated bibliography</strong> of the
  sources you intend to use.
Each source should be accompanied by a brief description, stating what
  it is about and how you plan to use it.</p>
<p>Paper proposals will not receive individual grades, but will be graded
  together with the final paper.</p>
<h4>Final Presentation</h4>
<p>Each team will make a short (5-10 minutes) presentation about their research on the last day of class.</p>
<h4>Final Term Paper</h4>
<p>The final deliverable is a paper of 5,000–7,000 words, due at the end
  of the semester.
The papers will be shared with other students and will be evaluated by
  the instructor according to the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use of sources.</strong> The paper should be based on substantial
  research — you should plan to drawing on academic books and
  articles, not on blogs or Wikipedia. The sources need to be used and
  documented in an appropriate way.</li>
<li><strong>Quality of the argument.</strong> The paper should present a coherent and
  original argument.
  It should not repeat what is readily available in other sources.
  It also should not meander through a collection of unrelated ideas.</li>
<li><strong>Quality of writing.</strong> The paper should be well written. Being well
  written means your use of language should not stand in the way of
  the reader’s comprehension of your text, either by obfuscating the
  meaning or by drawing the reader’s attention from the content of
  your writing to its form.</li>
</ul>
<p>The final grade for the paper will also incorporate an assessment of
  your original proposal and the presentation.</p>
<h3>Paper Proposal Reviews — 10%</h3>
<p>Each student will receive three proposals from other teams and will
  then be asked to write a review of each proposal.
The reviews should be constructive in their focus and aim to help the
  author of each proposal improve their paper.
Each review should be 1–2 pages long and can include a bibliography if
  appropriate.
(If you include a bibliography, do not count it towards the page
  limit.)</p>
<h3>A Course “Patch” — 10%</h3>
<p>Each student will be asked to submit a “patch” (modification) to the
  course.
The patches will be submitted via Github, which will include the
  actual modification and a brief summary.
Additionally, a one-page justification should be submitted via email.</p></div><div class='box' id='readings'><h1>Readings and Resources</h1>
<p>The course will rely on readings that fall roughly into two categories.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Primary sources.</strong> 
  Those are writings by people closely involved with free / open
    source software, which will give us a first-hand perspective on
    this phenomenon.
  We will be looking at writings by Richard Stallman, Linus Torvalds,
    and Eric Raymond, as well as a few others.
  When approaching such texts we will read them in the same way that
    primary texts are read in humanities, asking questions about the
    relationship between each text and the historical and cultural
    millieu in which it was written.
  Students should not be mislead by the seeming ease of such texts,
    and should try to dig deeper into them.</li>
<li><strong>Academic analyses.</strong>
  Those are academic writings either looking at free / open source
    software directly or exploring closely related topics such as
    copyright and history of software.
  Some of those texts can be quite challenging, as they may be
    positioned within academic debates the students may be unfamiliar
    with.
  Please budget your time accordingly.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Availability of the Readings</h4>

<h2>Week 2</h2>
<h3>Monday, July 15, 2013<br/>Intellectual Property: Theory and History</h3>
<p>To properly contextualize free / open source software, we must first understand
why software is protected as intellectual property in the first place.
In this class we look at the history and theory behind intellectual propertly generally.
What are “public goods”?
(Specifically, what does it mean for something to be “nonrival” and “non-excludable”?)
In what sense are ideas and software “public goods”?
Why might it make sense to limit the use of information goods?
What are some of the other ways of supporting production of such goods?
What would be some of the alternatives to intelletual property?</p>

<p>How did the free software movement arise in the 1980s? What is
“copyleft”? In what sense is the free software movement a
“movement”? How does it work? What is its ideology and why is
it important? What is the role of non-profit foundations?</p>

<h2>Week 7</h2>
<h3>Monday, August 19, 2013<br/>Student Presentations</h3>
<p><span class="important">Students present their work.</span> No
readings.</p>
<p><span class="important">An electronic submission of the paper
is due through TurnItIn by midnight on «TBD».</span></p>
<p><span class="important">An electronic submission of the “course patch”
is due through TurnItIn by midnight on «TBD».</span></p></div><div class='box' id='procedures'><h1>General Expectations and Procedures</h1>
<p>The students are expected to come to class prepared
and submit assignments strictly on time.</p>
<h3>Late Assignments and Extensions</h3>
<p>You are expected to complete assignments on time. Assignment not
submitted by the exact time when their are due will be considered
late. (E.g., “17:00” means “17:00”, not “17:05.”)</p>
<h4>Late Policy for Memos</h4>
<p><span class="important">
Late memos will recieve half of the credit if submitted before the beginning of class.
Memos not submitted by the time the class begins will not be accepted at all.</span>
Students who have missed a memo should focus their efforts on memos for the next class.
However, each student will be entitled to skipping <span class="important">one</span> memo.</p>
<h4>Late Policy for Other Deliverables</h4>
<p>For all other assignments there will be a penalty of
<span class="important">half a grade (e.g. from A to A–) for any assignment not submitted on time,
with an an additional half-grade penalty deducted for any further 24 hours</span>
that the assignment is late.
Work that is not handed in one week (168 hours) after it was due will not be accepted.</p>
<h3>TurnItIn</h3>
<p><span class="important">Normally, students will be required to submit
the term paper to <a href="http://turnitin.com/">TurnItIn</a> for a review
of textual similarity and detection of possible plagiarism. In doing
so, students will allow their essays to be included as source
documents in the Turnitin.com reference database, where they will be
used solely for the purpose of detecting plagiarism. The terms that
apply to the University’s use of the Turnitin.com service are
described on the Turnitin.com web site.</span></p>
<p>Students who do not wish to use TurnItIn for submitting their work
should approach the instructor to discuss alternative ways to
establish the originality of the paper. This discussion needs to
happen before the student begins working on the paper.</p>
<p>For information on how to use TurnItIn, please see this handout:
<a href="handouts/turnitin_instructions.pdf">turnitin_instructions.pdf</a>.</p>
