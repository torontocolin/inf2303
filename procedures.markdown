# General Expectations and Procedures

The students are expected to come to class prepared
and submit assignments strictly on time.

### Late Assignments and Extensions

You are expected to complete assignments on time. Assignment not
submitted by the exact time when their are due will be considered
late. (E.g., “17:00” means “17:00”, not “17:05.”)

#### Late Policy for Memos

<span class="important">
Late memos will recieve half of the credit if submitted before the beginning of class.
Memos not submitted by the time the class begins will not be accepted at all.</span>
Students who have missed a memo should focus their efforts on memos for the next class.
However, each student will be entitled to skipping <span class="important">one</span> memo.

#### Late Policy for Other Deliverables

For all other assignments there will be a penalty of
<span class="important">half a grade (e.g. from A to A–) for any assignment not submitted on time,
with an an additional half-grade penalty deducted for any further 24 hours</span>
that the assignment is late.
Work that is not handed in one week (168 hours) after it was due will not be accepted.

### TurnItIn

<span class="important">Normally, students will be required to submit
the term paper to [TurnItIn](http://turnitin.com/) for a review
of textual similarity and detection of possible plagiarism. In doing
so, students will allow their essays to be included as source
documents in the Turnitin.com reference database, where they will be
used solely for the purpose of detecting plagiarism. The terms that
apply to the University’s use of the Turnitin.com service are
described on the Turnitin.com web site.</span>

Students who do not wish to use TurnItIn for submitting their work
should approach the instructor to discuss alternative ways to
establish the originality of the paper. This discussion needs to
happen before the student begins working on the paper.

For information on how to use TurnItIn, please see this handout:
[turnitin_instructions.pdf](handouts/turnitin_instructions.pdf).
